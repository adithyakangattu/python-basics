# in python, logical operators (and, or, and not)
#are used to combine or modify conditions to control the flow of a program.

# and operator: returns true if both conditions are true,

# or operator: returns true if one condition is true .

# not operator: reverse the result of a condition :
# if a condition is true, not makes it false and vice verse .
