#Task: Write a Python function called summarize_numbers
#Create a function that can take an arbitrary number of numerical arguments.
# The function should print the following:

#The total sum of the numbers.
#The average of the numbers.
#If no numbers are provided, it should print: "No numbers provided."
#Call the function with the numbers(10,20,and 30.)


def sum_numbers(*args):
    if len(args)== 0:
        print("no numbers provided")
        return
    total_sum = sum(args)
    average = total_sum / len(args)

    print("total sum:", total_sum)
    print("average:", average)

#calling the number with the numbers 10,20 and 30
sum_numbers(10,20,30)
