#Task: Write a Python function called track_scores
#Create a function that can take an arbitrary number of game scores as arguments.
# The function should print:

#The highest score.
#The lowest score.
#The total number of scores provided.
#If no scores are provided, it should print: "No scores to track."
#Call the function with the scores(45,67,and89.)


def track_scores(*scores):
    if not scores:
        print("no scores to track,")
    else:
        highest_score = max(scores)
        lowest_score = min(scores)
        total_score = len(scores)

        print(f"highest score: {highest_score}")
        print(f"lowest score:{lowest_score}")
        print(f"total number of scores: {total_score}")

track_scores(45, 67, 89)
