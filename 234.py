#recursion
#python also accepts function recursion ,
# which means a defined function can call itself .

#example of a recursive function-

def factorial(x):

    if x == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return (x * factorial(x-1))      # 3 * 2

num = 3
print("the factorial of", num , "is", factorial(num))


# factorial of 3 = 1*2*3 = 6
