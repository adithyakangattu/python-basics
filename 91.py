#create a tuple with one item

#to create a tuple with only one item
#you have to add a comma after the item,
#otherwise python will not recognise it as a tuple


#one item tuple, remember the comma,

thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#not a tuple

thistuple1 = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple1))
